# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

    path: "persia"  # path to check out source code, relative to the agent's build directory (e.g. \_work\1)
    persistCredentials: boolean  # set to 'true' to leave the OAuth token in the Git config after the initial fetch
